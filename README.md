# twilio-demo.py

This Python script uses Twilio to send a friendly invite to “A Y”, a Google designer, and logs the message with SQLAlchemy ORM. A warm, multi-line message is crafted and sent via Twilio SMS. The message content, a mock user ID, and the timestamp are then stored in a SQLite database for traceability. SQLAlchemy offers a clean, scalable ORM interface, making it ideal for small apps or prototypes needing reliable, easy-to-maintain data storage.
